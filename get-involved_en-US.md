##Get Involved

###Welcome

AOSC, Anthon Open Source Community is a community, as you can see. So what makes a community real, or in another word, geniune? 

- Open participation

Yes, participation.

###Why Participate?

This question comes in a specific way, especially in our community. AOSC is unique for its population content, that is: more than 50% of the participants are students (mainly high schoolers), and almost 100% percent of them are from Mainland, China. What comes in place given by this population content?

- Limited participation, and even according to the amount of homework given, exams, even by their grades.
- Unstable development progress, from the beginning of this community, with the given schedule, the progress is uneven throughout the year (AOSC's development runs in cycles of years)

Your participation can push our progress forward in a year, make the projects better, or even something better can happen in your hands.

###How to Participate?

For now, the best way to participate is to join the community group.

- for IRC users go to: #anthon at freenode.net
- for QQ users (mainly from Mainland China) go to group: 125016052

Note: These 2 groups are binded with each other, so what you've said in one side will be reposted to another. No log will be made.

###What Can I Participate?

AOSC is a community that tolerates members with no sufficient skills for even installing our distribution, to the ones who build the distribution itself. To make it possible for everyone to participate, the community has split the work into the following:

- Localization, for members with sufficient language skills for translating amount en_US, zh_CN, zh_TW (from one to another)
- Maintaining, for members with skills of using "autobuild", our packaging toolkit, and basic knowledge to Linux distribution building (shell usage, environment configuration, etc)
- Projects, our community is not only holding one distribution project, there are projects to enrich the experience of the distribution. A good example in this case would be Anthon Starter, a helper for Windows users to install distribution from AOSC. Anyone with sufficient skills and interest can Pull Request in our Git repository
- Management, for managing the website, the servers or even the communication group
- Documentation, a community needs good documentations for leading newcomers, training developers, and many other matters
- Others, anything you believe that helps the community, please do it, but try to communicate with the others before

###Split

[HERE BELOW TO DESCRIBE ALL PARTS OF PARTICIPATION AVAILABLE]

###[PAGE] Localization

The localization happens at our Localization site, kindly sponsored by Crowdin. -> l10n.anthonos.org

**How It Works**

Sometimes, during usage of software, many non-English user may find some of the software are half localized, or even not localized at all. This can bring trouble to daily usage. So we collects reports from users or community members, for software packages that has these problems, bring them together, and upload them to this site. And heres what happens with them:

- The managers notify translators about the new projects to be translated, or localized
- The translators translates the projects (with collabration support from Crowdin, there may not be a need to negotiate with each other with the jobs ahead)
- The proofreaders checks for errors
- Localization releases, and merged into packages

Lastly, those translation improvements will be actively provided to the upstream.

###[PAGE] Maintaining

AOSC OS may be the largest project of the community, it takes around 500 or more hours of effort, with the current team of 4 to build such a distribution ground up. But building is not the only effort you put into a distribution. Maintaining matters, for users who may use the distribution for the next year till the next major release. Maintainers needs to know about some basic concepts like dependencies, package managements, compilers, patches... In our case you need to learn about:

- Autobuild, our packaging toolkit which takes care of DPKG and RPM at the same time by abstracting their processes
- Basic knowledge of UNIX Shell
- Some knowledge on how to build software from source, and how to fix them when errors occur during the build
- Ways to make the software packages work

[GitHub WIKI]

And for most cases you may proceed with the knowledge given above.

###[PAGE] Projects

[PROJECT DESCRIPTION HERE]

###[PAGE] Management

It's not only the people that makes the community, there's many infrastructures and tools for the community to run better. Like this website you are seeing, and the communication group we are using for collabration and discussions. 

[NOT FINISHED]

###[PAGE] Documentations

Documentations are the gateway for people to step in the community, to use the software project, and to participate in the community. It's an important job to make sure the documentations are updated and complete. Currently, there are two places that needs documentation feeds:

- The wiki site, -> wiki.anthonos.org , but due to some attackers we closed the sign up, so to sign up, you need permissions from the development team, and it's posted on the Homepage of the wiki
- GitHub repositories, sophisticated projects like autobuild needs a whole lot of documentations for telling people how to use it properly

###[PAGE] Others

- You may start your own project and use the community as a host and a platform for collabration opportunities
- You can make suggestions that can make the community a better place
- You can take actions to tell others about us, or make more people to join and participate

Your action matters.
